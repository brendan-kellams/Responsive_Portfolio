			<p>Hello everyone!  My name is Brendan Kellams and I'm a web developer in training.  I attended the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Psychology.  I have done many interesting and different things in my life like teaching English in China, worked with special needs students (if that doesn't teach you patience, I don't know what will) and plan, organized, and conducted a community service project involving more than 100 people at the age of 17.</p>
				
			<p>Some of my interests include: computer building, photography, cinematography, music, and singing and making funny sounds when no one is around.  I'm kinda a pro at that.  I hope you enjoy some of the things that I have made and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me at github, linkedin, Stack Overflow, or by email!  Have an awesome day!!!</p>
